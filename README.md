This project is an interactive HR dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into employee attrition, including visualizations for attrition by various factors such as years at the company, education level, job role, job satisfaction, and age group. The dashboard also features gender-specific filters for deeper analysis.
## Project Overview
